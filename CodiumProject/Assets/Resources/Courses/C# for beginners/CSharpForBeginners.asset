  - subject: Basic Math
    explaination: 'C# has the power to do amazing things.


      Let''s start by making the computer do some simple math.'
    codeBulletPoints:
    - You can add (<b>+</b>), subtract (<b>-</b>), divide (<b>/</b>) and multiply
      (<b>*</b>) using C#.
    - Simply type in the expression you want to calculate.
    - 
    exampleBulletPoints:
    - <b>2 + 2</b>
    - <b>4 * 5 + 1</b>
    - 
    goal: Calculate something.

    defaultCode: 
    solutionCode: 2+3
    hint: 4+5 would be a possible solution.

  - subject: Decimal Numbers
    explaination: 'If we try to calculate <b>1/2</b> we will get the result <b>0</b>.


      That''s because we are currently using whole numbers resulting in <b>0.5</b>
      being rounded down to <b>0</b>.


      To fix this we add <b>f</b> at the end of the division.'
    codeBulletPoints:
    - 
    - 
    - 
    exampleBulletPoints:
    - <b>1 / 2 + 3f</b> will only force the <b>3</b> into a decimal number and result
      in <b>3</b>
    - <b>4 / 5f + 2</b> will correctly result in <b>0.8</b>.
    - 
    goal: Calculate a decimal point number.

  - subject: Strings
    explaination: 'Text in C# is called a string. A string begins and ends with a
      quote ( <b>"</b> ).


      We can do a bunch of stuff with strings, let''s start by getting its length.'
    codeBulletPoints:
    - Create a string by typing some text wrapped in quotes ( <b>"</b> ).
    - Use .Length to get number of characters in the string.
    - 
    exampleBulletPoints:
    - String are often used for names. "Dwayne Johnson" is a string.
    - '"Dwayne Johnson".Length prints the length of the string.'
    - 
    goal: Print the length of your name.
    instructionBulletPoints:
    - Write your name in quotes.
    - Add .Length to the end of your name (after the quotes).
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
    defaultCode: 
    solutionCode: '"Dwayne Johnson".Length'
    hint: Remember to put ';' at the end of the line.
