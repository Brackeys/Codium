------ Version 1.1.0 ------
Recommended Unity version is 5.3.2f1, compatible down to 5.2.2f1

-- IMPROVEMENTS --
- [Buttons] Massive performance improvements in both the editor and (especially) at runtime!
- [Buttons] A bit easier to use, thanks to an inspector redecoration and unneeded method/variable culling.
- [Components] Almost every component now has a interactable boolean, similar to that on standard uGUI components. (interactable can still be toggled manually on uGUI components for custom 'disabled' behaviour).
- [DialogAnimator] Added ability to choose slide in/out direction and tween type (you can see an example of how to use that in the Dialog example scene).
- [Divider] Added ability to create vertical dividers.
- [Icons] Update MaterialDesign icon set (41 new icons).
- [InputField] Improved the use of customTextValidator, we now just need to call IsTextValid() instead of ValidateText(text, validationText).
- [InputField] Added option to only validate text upon first selection of InputField, rather than on Start.
- [Panel] Added more creation options (go to MaterialUI -> Panel to see them).
- [Performance] The sprites used by MaterialUI are now packed into a spritesheet for better use of space at runtime.
- [Performance] Improved shadow behaviour and performance, now each shadow doesn't have its own Update().
- [Ripple] New 'SetGraphicColor' method correctly sets the graphic's color, regardless of its ripple/highlight settings. Smooth animation to new color is optional.
- [Ripple] Added property 'rippleColor' to change ripple color and automatically update the highlight color.
- [Ripple] Added highlight blend amount option (to specify the amount of blend to use when automatic highlight is selected).
- [SelectionControl] Now has some layout components so it's always nicely aligned in every layout group.
- [Slider] Added option to make left/right content opacity less, when not interactable.
- [Tab] Added a simple SetPage method that you can now call from the UnityEvent system in the inspector to change tabs.
- [Tab] Renamed pageEnabled to interactable.
- [Tab] Lower disabled Tab opacity.
- [Tween] Massively improved the Tween engine, which is now way faster! But will break your script if you used the old one.
- [Tween] Completely rewrote the tweening engine which now uses a new tweening method and pools tweens, resulting in a system which is now orders of magnitude faster! It's also a bit easy to use and keep track of active tweens.

-- FIXES --
- [Dialog] No longer overrides parentCanvas if it is set manually.
- [Dialog] Fixed the dialog example scene.
- [Divider] Now have a min width/height (depending on horizontal or vertical divider) of 1.
- [Dropdown] Fixed bug where the first expansion of a dropdown would be positioned incorrectly, and sometimes go offscreen.
- [Dropdown] Fixed issue where Dropdowns created under a LayoutGroup would sometimes have a width of 0.
- [InputField] No longer rebuilds the canvas every frame when it doesn't need to.
- [Ripple] Fixed issue where enabling 'auto highlight color' at runtime wouldn't automatically refresh the color.
- [Screen] Fixed issue where transitioning to the already current screen would break things.
- [Slider] Fixed behaviour if 'hasPopup' is false.
- [Slider] Fixed incorrect icon color (it was too dark).
- [Slider] Fixed issue where Sliders created under a LayoutGroup would sometimes have a width of 0.
- [Toggles] Fixed issue where RadioButtons would have incorrect labels on Start().
- [Tween] Removed from 'Add Component' menu as it is not a component to add on any GameObject.
- [VectorImage] Icons where not updated when changed via the Icon Picker while the Editor is playing.
