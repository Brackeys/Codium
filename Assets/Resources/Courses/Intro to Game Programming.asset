    explaination: 'Everything you can see in the game is called a GameObject.


      GameObjects have different properties which can be manipulated through code.'
    codeBulletPoints:
    - To access properties in a GameObject we use the '<b>.</b>'' operator.
    - Sometimes you have to use the '<b>.</b>'' multiple times to access the property
      you want.
    - 
    exampleBulletPoints:
    - Cube.transform.position accesses the position of our Cube.
    - Cube.renderer.material accesses the way the object looks.
    - 
    goal: Change the color of the Cube to your liking.
    instructionBulletPoints:
    - Access the Cubes color property under Cube.renderer.material.
    - Set the color property equal to Color.red.
    - (Optional) Try the same with blue, green and yellow.
